# Production Problem 09: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1. http://usabilitygeek.com/usability-testing-mobile-applications/
2. http://blog.intransure.com/25-point-website-usability-checklist/

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1.  Pages use the IIT logo to ensure legitimacy
2.  Site has no 404 pages, links go where they need to
3.  CSS animations move logically
4.  Tone of the text remains professional throughout
5.  Fonts do not fall back to serif, sans-serif, or monospace on any browser
6.  Log out button acknowledges that the user has been logged out after press
7.  Submit buttons function identically to Enter key
8.  DRY principles in class signup design
9.  Larger media queries do not add any exclusive features
10. Site's "hotdog" is addressed; tackles the original Add/Drop task
