## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52m0u0kllllFsUVs1aKeR411buc
Your Rationale: To me, a yellow-green has always carried a certain connotation of something being particularly technological and outstanding, but only when paired with a white and black. Potential buyers of this gaming platform might want to feel as though the product they're choosing performs at high speeds and brings new and innovating things with it, and I think these colors allow for that feeling.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=32E0G0kwpsT1HZIl7AdG5h++S00
Your Rationale: I don't think I would use a triad theme for this, but based on what I was able to create, I felt that, other than green being pretty much mandatory for representing flourishing plant life, there was a nice shade of purple used on their home page https://www.chicagobotanic.org/ in a picture, and I thought that was nice. Orange seemed to be the next best color to pair with it as far as the triad would allow, so I stuck with that, adjusting the inner circle to make the saturation a little cleaner.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=54a0A0kwUpb3cXrn3vXKufh++00
Your Rationale: With the saturation just a hair darker than normal, the colors seem to be trying to suggest a stout, serious line of defense, rather than something that can't take itself seriously. Blue has always suggested defense and security to me, so I felt that was a must--I don't think people would want to seek out a "private" messaging app that makes you wonder if you're really okay with trusting the company the app represents, so security comes first.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1020u0kubH4du6B51nW1Se3teaV
Your Rationale: I seem to remember the Ruby on Rails book being white, black, and red. As far as the color of the ruby gem would go, I think red fits thematically.
